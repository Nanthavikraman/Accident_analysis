# Traffic Accident Prediction Using AI

## Overview
This project leverages AI to predict traffic accidents by analyzing historical accident data, traffic patterns, weather conditions, and driver behavior. The aim is to proactively identify high-risk zones and scenarios to help reduce accidents and enable timely interventions.

## Features
- Predict traffic accident severity (e.g., severe vs. non-severe).
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.
- Visualizations of prediction results and feature importance.

## Technologies
- **Python** with libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Random Forest Classifier.
